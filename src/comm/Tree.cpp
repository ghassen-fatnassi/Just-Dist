// This is a C++ implementation of the tree reduction algorithm.
// The tree reduction algorithm is a parallel reduction technique that efficiently combines elements in a distributed system.
// It works by organizing the data in a tree topology and performing pairwise communication between elements at each level of the tree.
// This implementation assumes a power of two number of elements and uses a barrier for synchronization.
