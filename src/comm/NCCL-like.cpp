// This is a C++ implementation of the NCCL-like reduction algorithm.
// The NCCL-like reduction algorithm is a parallel reduction technique that efficiently combines elements in a distributed system.
// It works by using a hierarchical communication pattern to reduce data across multiple GPUs or nodes.
// This implementation assumes a power of two number of elements and uses a barrier for synchronization.
