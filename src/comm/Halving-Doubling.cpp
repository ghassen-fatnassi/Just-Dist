// This is a C++ implementation of the halving-doubling algorithm.
// The halving-doubling algorithm is a parallel reduction technique that efficiently combines elements in a distributed system.
// It works by halving the number of active threads in each step, allowing for efficient data reduction.
// This implementation assumes a power of two number of elements and uses a barrier for synchronization.
