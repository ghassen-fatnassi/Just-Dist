// This is a C++ implementation of the ring reduction algorithm.
// The ring reduction algorithm is a parallel reduction technique that efficiently combines elements in a distributed system.
// It works by organizing the data in a ring topology and performing pairwise communication between neighboring elements.
// This implementation assumes a power of two number of elements and uses a barrier for synchronization.
